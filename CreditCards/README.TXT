PROJECT TITLE: Creditcards

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
reate a new project in your Java development environment and create a class called CreditCard. The CreditCard class should have the following fields:

cardNumber: a string that represents the credit card number
balance: a double that represents the current balance on the credit card
interestRate: a double that represents the annual interest rate of the credit card
Define a constructor for the CreditCard class that takes two arguments: the cardNumber and the interestRate. The constructor should initialize the cardNumber and interestRate fields with the values passed as arguments, and set the balance field to 0.0.

Define the following methods for the CreditCard class:

charge(double amount): a method that charges the specified amount to the credit card and updates the balance accordingly. If the amount is negative, the method should print an error message and not make any changes to the balance.
pay(double amount): a method that makes a payment to the credit card and updates the balance accordingly. If the amount is negative, the method should print an error message and not make any changes to the balance.
getInterest(): a method that calculates and returns the amount of interest that has accrued on the credit card balance based on the interest rate.
Test the CreditCard class by creating a CreditCard object and calling the charge(), pay(), and getInterest() methods with various inputs. Make sure that the balance is updated correctly and that the interest is calculated correctly.
